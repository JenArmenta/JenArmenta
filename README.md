Hi, I’m @JenArmenta!

In every role I have held, I naturally gravitate toward streamlining processes and creating documentation. I love improving processes, and I care deeply about making an impact and supporting the people I work with. 

My superpower is my unique blend of technical expertise and my empathy, and ability to collaborate with technical and non-technical teams.

**PROFESSIONALLY:**
I am a Technical Writer, certified Salesforce Administrator and I love learning new software and platforms!
I have completed the Front End Developer Training Program through Skillcrush, where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and Responsive design.

  * Extensive experience writing software documentation, process documentation, workflow maps, SOPs, user manuals, training and onboarding guides, and knowledge base materials.
  * Recognized for my outstanding interpersonal and communication skills.
  * Ability to work effectively with cross functional teams, at all organizational levels.
  * I bring structure, clarity, and positive energy to every project I work on!  
 
 
**PERSONALLY:**
I am a wife, mom and geek. I love table-top role playing games, beer flights, darkwave and continuously learning new things!
