Hi, Iâ€™m @JenArmenta!

I am a techie empath... writer, editor, leader... certified scrum master and process maven!

I have completed the Front End Developer Training Program through Skillcrush, where I learned HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and Responsive design. I also learned the basics of JavaScript and React.

My gift is my empathy and strong emotional intelligence, as well as my writing, communication, and technical skills. 

I have 10 years of experience writing and editing. Five of these years were writing/editing technical documents, including SOPs, training manuals, reports and software documentation. 

More about me... I am mom, wife, and geek. I love table-top role playing games, beer flights, goth music and darkwave.
