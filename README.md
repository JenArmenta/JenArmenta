Hi, I’m @JenArmenta!

I am a techie coach, leader and certified Scrum Master. I have a passion for helping teams and individuals thrive by creating a safe environment that fosters team growth and collaboration.

I’m currently enrolled in the Frontend Developer Training Program through Skillcrush. I have finished the HTML, CSS, Git and Responsive design classes. I am currently in the middle of JavaScript and React is next!

More about me... I am mom, wife, empath, and geek. I love table-top role playing games, beer flights, goth music and darkwave.
