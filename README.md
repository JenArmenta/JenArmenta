Hi, I’m @JenArmenta!

I’m currently enrolled in the Frontend Developer Training Program through Skillcrush. I have finished the HTML, CSS, Git and Responsive design classes. I am currently in the middle of Javescript and React is next!

More about me... I am mom, wife, empath, and geek. I love table-top role playing games, beer flights, goth music and darkwave.

You can reach me at jenarmenta@gmail.com.
