Hi, I’m @JenArmenta!

I am a techie coach, writer, leader and certified Scrum Master. 

I’m currently enrolled in the Frontend Developer Training Program through Skillcrush. I have finished the HTML, CSS, GitHub, Responsive design and JavaScript class. I am currently in the middle of React!

As a writer and editor, I have over seven years of experience on various projects, including training materials, company handbooks, presentations, articles and web content. Three years of that time was spent editing technical audit reports for industrial smelters who were non-native English speakers. 

I have a passion for helping teams and individuals thrive by creating a safe environment that fosters team growth and collaboration.

More about me... I am mom, wife, empath, and geek. I love table-top role playing games, beer flights, goth music and darkwave.
